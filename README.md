Easy QR Code Generator API API Documentation
QR Code Generator API is a RESTful web service that allows developers to generate QR codes on-the-fly.
With this API, developers can easily create QR codes for various types of data, including URLs, plain text, phone numbers, and more. 
The API accepts a GET request with a single parameter, “data” which is the data you want to encode in the QR code, in the form of a string. 
The API will then generate the QR code image based on the provided data and return it in the form of a PNG image. The API is simple and easy to use, 
making it ideal for developers who need to generate QR codes for their mobile or web applications. It is also suitable for businesses that need to create 
QR codes for marketing campaigns or for use in other types of print or digital media. The API is also flexible, allowing developers to customize the QR code
with options such as size, color, and error correction level. The API is available on RapidAPI, and you can access it by subscribing to a pricing plan on the website. 
The API documentation is also available on the RapidAPI website, which contains detailed information on how to use the API, including examples of how to make requests 
and parse responses.
With QR Code Generator API, you can easily generate QR codes for your use case, whether it be for personal or commercial use.
